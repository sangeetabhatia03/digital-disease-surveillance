# Overview
The lecture and tutorial are based on our [work](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00442-3) on using digital
disease surveillance data to do real-time outbreak analysis. I will
also illustrate the challenges of generating actionable insights from
disease surveillance data scraped manually from news media using an
[example](https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15805.3) from the early phase of COVID-19.

## Data 
### Ebola

The first motivating example comes from the 2013â€“2016 West African
Ebola epidemic. We will use two Ebola data sets:
- curated ProMED and HealthMap records on the human cases of Ebola
   Virus Disease in West Africa;
- West African Ebola incidence data collated by the WHO during the
  epidemic. We will use a ``clean'' version of this data that was made
  available [here](https://doi.org/10.1098%2Frstb.2016.0308), ~1 year
  after the end of the pandemic.

Our second motivating example is the early phase of the COVID-19
pandemic, when a large number of researchers and volunteers were
trying to collate emerging data on the cases and deaths.
